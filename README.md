# House Price Regression Analysis

This was project from an entry level kaggle compettion that orignally took place on 8/30/2016

It was used as my first project to demonstrate my DS skills and was completed on 02/12/2018 with a RMSE score of 0.15453 using XGBoost

It was later revisted on 12/7/2019 and updated

Added to a new Repo on 03/21/2020

TensorFlow was added as an additional ML technique on 4/22/2020 but even after extensive tuning, it could not perform better than XGBoost.
